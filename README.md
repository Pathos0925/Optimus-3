## :rocket: Optimus-3 
<img src="./assets/fig1.png" >
Given the task "Craft a diamond sword based on the current inventory", Optimus-3 employs Captioning to perceive and interpret the inventory information, Grounding to select appropriate tools, Planning to generate sub-goals based on available materials, Action to execute these sub-goals sequentially, Reflection to assess the current task state, and Embodied QA to verify whether the task has been successfully completed. 



## 🎮 Play with Optimus-3
[![YouTube Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0VOT4PMgf7Y/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VOT4PMgf7Y)

We provide an interactive interface that enables users to interact with Optimus-3 in Minecraft in real time through a GUI. You can interact with Optimus-3 through instructions to perform Planning, Long-horizon Actions, Captioning, Embodied QA, and Grounding. This is a framework with a separation between the server and client. You can deploy the model on the server (we strongly recommend a GPU with at least 32GB of VRAM), and then initiate interaction with the server from your local machine at any time. Download the Optimus-3-preview version on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MinecraftOptimus/Optimus-3).

### Instructions

> [!TIP]
> **Action rule:** Planning must precede action. Then simply click **Action** — no further instructions required.

| Mode |  Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
|🧠 Planning  | `get a xxx` | Plan the steps before taking actions. |
|🖼️ Captioning  | `describe this view` | Describe what you see in the current view. |
|❓ EQA  | `how many xxx` | Answer questions about the environment. |
|🎯 Grounding  | `locate the xxx` | Locate objects / regions in the view. |
|🖱️ Action  | *(click / interact)* | Execute the planned actions. |

#### Controls
- ⏸️ **Pause**: pause to switch tasks.
- 🔄 **Reset**: reset the environment (agent position will be randomly initialized).


### Server
Server are deployed on machines with a GPU with at least 28GB of VRAM.
```shell
# install java 8
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo apt install xvfb

# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# download the repo
git clone https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Optimus-3.git
cd Optimus-3

# environment setting
uv sync

uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Minestudio setting
# We have made some modifications to the original MineStudio. Please use the version we provided.
cd MineStudio
uv pip install -e .
cd ..

# install LLaMA-Factory
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
uv pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]"

# install flash-attention
uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

# download checkpoints
mkdir checkpoint
download Optimus-3 mllm (https://huggingface.co/MinecraftOptimus/Optimus-3) into folder 'checkpoint'
download Optimus-3 action head (https://huggingface.co/MinecraftOptimus/Optimus-3-ActionHead) into folder 'checkpoint'
download Optimus-3 task router (https://huggingface.co/MinecraftOptimus/Optimus-3-Task-Router) into folder 'checkpoint'
download original sentence-bert (https://huggingface.co/efederici/sentence-bert-base) into folder 'checkpoint'

# change the ckpt path
change the optimus3 (actionhead,mllm,task router) checkpoint path in gui_server.py (line 229)
change the optimus3 task router checkpoint path in ./src/minecraftoptimus/model/agent/optimus3.py (line 64)
change the sentence-bert checkpoint path in ./src/minecraftoptimus/model/optimus3/modeling_task_router.py (line 11)

# Communication IP settings
input the ip of your server in gui_server.py (line 459)
```

### Client
The client is deployed on your local machine.
```shell

# download the repo
git clone https://github.com/lizaijing/OptimusGUI.git
cd OptimusGUI

# Configuring the python environment
Some basic python packages, e.g., python>=3.11 pyqt6 requests numpy...

# Communication IP settings
input the ip of your server in main.py (line 11) and server/api.py (line 12)
```

### How to run
```shell

# start the server
python gui_server.py

# start the client
python main.py

# note 
If you encounter an error about the 'collection', change collections to collections.abc in the corresponding location.
If you encounter an error about the 'model_type', you can change the model_type (line 22) into "qwen2_5_vl" in /checkpoint/Optimus3/config.json
```

### 🌐 Web client (browser — recommended for SSH / VS Code)

This fork adds a **single-port Flask web client** (`web_client.py`) as an alternative to the PyQt desktop client. The browser talks only to the Flask app, which reverse-proxies both the REST API and the live-frame WebSocket to the server — so you only need to forward **one** port.

```shell
# 1. start the server (sets Java 8 on PATH, runs under xvfb, GPU rendering on by default)
./run_server.sh

# 2. start the web client (defaults to port 7860; SERVER_HOST/SERVER_PORT/CLIENT_PORT are overridable)
./run_client.sh
```

Then forward the client port (default **7860**) — e.g. in the VS Code **Ports** panel — and open `http://localhost:7860`.

Features: live POV view, the task modes (Planning / Captioning / Embodied QA / Grounding), single-step **Action** + **Auto-run**, Pause / Resume / Reset, a frames-per-second counter, a **💭 Show thinking** toggle (shows the model's `<think>` reasoning), and a **render-resolution selector** (640×360 → 1920×1080; higher is sharper but lower fps).

> **Tip — workflow:** select **Planning**, enter a goal (e.g. `craft a diamond sword`), **Send**, then click **Auto-run** to execute the plan. Planning is conditioned on the current view, so plan from a clear surface spot.

### ⚡ GPU rendering (optional, big speedup)

By default the Minecraft client renders on the **CPU** (software GL), which caps the agent at ~20 fps. To render on the GPU instead (≈1.6× faster), install [VirtualGL](https://github.com/VirtualGL/virtualgl/releases) and set `MINESTUDIO_GPU_RENDER=1` (the default in `run_server.sh`):

```shell
# install VirtualGL (deb from the GitHub releases page), then ensure the GPU's DRI nodes are accessible
sudo usermod -aG video,render $USER          # (re-login to take effect)
# or, per session: sudo chmod a+rw /dev/dri/renderD128 /dev/dri/card*
```
`launchClient.sh` will then launch Minecraft under `vglrun` on the GPU. Set `MINESTUDIO_GPU_RENDER=0` to fall back to CPU rendering.

### 🛠️ Environment notes (this fork)

Pin these versions — newer releases break the model/loader:
- `transformers==4.51.3` (matches the checkpoint; 4.53+ removed the attention classes the model imports)
- `trl==0.19.1` and a **mid-2025 LLaMA-Factory** (commit `0b773234`) so `_register_composite_model` matches
- `fastapi` + `uvicorn` (not in `requirements.txt`); PyAV (`av==11.0.0`) needs `pkg-config` + ffmpeg `-dev` libs; `pyrender` needs `libglu1-mesa`

Other fixes included here: planning now passes the current view image to the model (fixes garbled plans) and trims its degenerate tail; the streamed view uses JPEG; per-step caching in the action policy; and the hardcoded asset path in `MineStudio/.../shell/craft_agent.py` is resolved from the module location.

## :wrench: Data Generation Pipeline
<img src="./assets/fig2.png" >
Given a task pool, we utilize a knowledge graph to generate task plans, forming the planning dataset. These plans are then used as instructions for STEVE-1, which interacts with the environment to produce the action dataset. During this process, we randomly sample images and employ expert models with environmental feedback to generate the captioning, embodied QA, and grounding datasets.


## 🧩 Framework

<img src="./assets/fig3.png" >
A: Overview of Optimus-3. Given observations and instructions, Optimus-3 couples System-1 fast reaction (Action) and System-2 deliberate reasoning (Embodied QA, Planning, Grounding, Reflection) within the Dual-Router Aligned MoE architecture. B: The details of Dual-Router Aligned MoE architecture. Horizontally, Task Router assigns each input to its corresponding task expert together with a shared knowledge expert. Vertically, Layer Router accelerates latency-sensitive action inference by selectively skipping intermediate layers. Both routing decisions are made once before the forward pass. C: Performance comparison of Optimus-3 against current task-specific SOTA agents, GPT-4o, and Qwen2.5-VL.

## 🌳 Dual-Granularity Reasoning-Aware Policy Optimization

<img src="./assets/fig4.png" >
Visualization examples of the task-specific fine-grained reward functions in DGRPO. For the Planning task, we design a Dependency-Aware Synthesis Reward, which treats the item's crafting dependency path as thinking reward and assigns fine-grained step-wise supervision as answer reward. For vision-related tasks, we introduce a Hallucination-Aware Consistency Reward that penalizes hallucinated items in the reasoning process and the final answer.
